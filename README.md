# Semantic-Semilarity-Checker
The Semantic Similarity Checker is a tool that allows users to compare the semantic similarity between texts in two different files. By leveraging pre-trained models such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, the system extracts text from the provided files and computes a semantic similarity score, indicating how similar the texts are.
